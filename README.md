Software Modeling

To run the application:

1. Run a git pull (to pull the repository to your own machine)
2. Then run the make command in the directory containing the repository
3. The make command will create a Test.exe which can now be run

Alternatively a Test.exe is included in this repository that you can run if you have made no changes to the code.

NOTE - This program uses g++ compiler to compile the source code
